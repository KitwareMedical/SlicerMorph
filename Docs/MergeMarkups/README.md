## MergeMarkups
**Summary:** This module provides a utility to consolidate semiLMs resampled on separate curves into a single node. If the merged curve meant to be continuous, the first landmark in the second (and subsequent curves) are removed to avoid redundancy, since they are identical (or close to) the last point on the previous curve.

### USAGE

To merge them, click and highlight the open curve nodes that are presented in the table. Note curves will be merged in the order they are shown in the table. You can change the ordering by dragging  individual curve nodes up and down in the list. If the curves represent a continuous curve, choose **Contiuous curves** option. Then, click **Merge  highligted nodes** to finalize.

## MorphologikaLMConverter
This module convertes [Morphologika 2.5](https://sites.google.com/site/hymsfme/downloadmorphologica) formated data files into series of fcsv files that can be used loaded into Slicer or directly input into the SlicerMorph's GPA module. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
User needs to locate a morphologika data file on disk, and specify an output folder where each specimen's landmarks will be saved individuall.y **Important Note:**  we use the optional data structure [names] to generate the filenames of individual fcsv files. 

Please let us know if you encounter issues using this module. Sharing your data file will greatly expedite the resolution, as we have only a couple morphologika data files to test the module.

So while an optional data structure, [names] is mandatory for this module to function correctly.

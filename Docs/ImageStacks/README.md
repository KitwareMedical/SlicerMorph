## ImageStacks
**Summary:** Imports non-DICOM image sequences (TIF/PNG/JPG/BMP) into 3D Slicer. It provides additional features such as only loading a subset of the data, downsampling (by factor of 2 in each axis), skipping slice(s) along the Z plane, and reverse the stack order. Users can also specify the voxel spacing for their dataset at the import time. Unlike the volume generated by the Slicer's default Load Data mechanism, `ImageStacks` always produces a ScalarVolume (single channel), so that volumes can be immediately visualized or can be processed with `Segment Editor`.

### USAGE
**Browse Files:** Use browse files to select a sequence of 2D images. Selection should only contain files of the same type. Also, it uses the ordering provided by the user. Make sure the selection is correctly ordered by the slice number in the OS dialog box. Hit Clear to reset the selection.

`ImageStacks` will display the image dimensions of the files currently selected, its data type, estimated memory usage at full and downsampled resolutions.

**Output Volume:** If left as None, the very first file in file selection will be used as the output volume node name. Alternatively, users create their own names using **Create New Volume As** option

**Spacing:** This specifies the voxel spacing in each axis. Note that unless changed by users, default unit in Slicer and SlicerMorph is millimeters. Values should be entered accordingly. (e.g., 15 micrometer should be entered as 0.015)

**Downsample:** If checked, it will downsample the volume by 2 in each axis, or a 8 folds reduction in data volume. Image spacing will be automatically adjusted for the downsampled volumes.

**Reverse:** If checked, it will reverse the ordering of files. This is useful to mitigate the mirror reflection problem of the specimens due to unknown nature of ordering (is it from top to bottom or bottom to top) of slices.

### KNOWN ISSUES
In MacOS when browsing for files, user has to scroll down slowly to make sure all files are correctly included in the final selection. Quickly selecting the first file and jumping all the way to the last causes breaks in the selection when there are a large number of files (typically in thoudsands range). This appears to be an issue  QT library and how it uses the native file browser in MacOS.

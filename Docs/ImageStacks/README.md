## ImageStacks
**Summary:** Imports non-DICOM image sequences (TIF/PNG/JPG/BMP) into 3D Slicer. It provides additional features such as only loading a subset of the data, downsampling (by factor of 2 in each axis), skipping slice(s) along the Z plane, and reverse the stack order. Users can also specify the voxel spacing for their dataset at the import time. Unlike the volume generated by the Slicer's default Load Data mechanism, `ImageStacks` always produces a ScalarVolume (single channel), so that volumes can be immediately visualized or can be processed with `Segment Editor`.

### USAGE
If you want to load all the images in a folder, drag either the folder or a single image onto the main Slicer application window. A popup message will ask if you want to use the `ImageStacks` module to load the data. File list table will be populated after accepting to use `ImageStacks`.

**Filename Pattern:** If the folder contains multiple image stacks with different convention, **Filename Pattern** option can be used to pick one sample file, which will be used to automatically select and order all files that use the same convention.   

**Browse Files:** Instead of importing all the files in folder, you want to import a subset of them use this option. Highlight all the sequence of images you would like to import. It is important that files are sorted by filename during the import. 

`ImageStacks` will display the image dimensions of the files currently selected, its data type, estimated memory usage at full and downsampled resolutions.

**Output Volume:** If left as None, the very first file in file selection will be used as the output volume node name. Alternatively, users create their own names using **Create New Volume As** option

**Spacing:** This specifies the voxel spacing in each axis. Note that unless changed by users, default unit in Slicer and SlicerMorph is millimeters. Values should be entered accordingly. (e.g., 15 micrometer should be entered as 0.015)

**Downsample:** If checked, it will downsample the volume by 2 in each axis, or a 8 folds reduction in data volume. Image spacing will be automatically adjusted for the downsampled volumes.

**Reverse:** If checked, it will reverse the ordering of files. This is useful to mitigate the mirror reflection problem of the specimens due to unknown nature of ordering (is it from top to bottom or bottom to top) of slices.

### KNOWN ISSUES
In MacOS, selecting large number of files (in thousands range) interactively with Browse Files may cause gaps in the selection, may result in an incorrect stack with missing selection. For such large number of files, either drag and drop a single file onto the application windowor the Filename Pattern option as described above.
